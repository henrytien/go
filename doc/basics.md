## Packages

This program is using the packages with import paths `"fmt"` and `"math/rand"`.

**Note:** The environment in which these programs are executed is deterministic, so each time you run the example program `rand.Intn` will return the same number.

(To see a different number, seed the number generator; see [`rand.Seed`](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Seed). Time is constant in the playground, so you will need to use something else as the seed.)
