## Packages

This program is using the packages with import paths `"fmt"` and `"math/rand"`.

**Note:** The environment in which these programs are executed is deterministic, so each time you run the example program `rand.Intn` will return the same number.

(To see a different number, seed the number generator; see [`rand.Seed`](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Seed). Time is constant in the playground, so you will need to use something else as the seed.)

## Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)
```

## Exported names	

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

## Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

(For more about why types look the way they do, see the [article on Go's declaration syntax](https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax).)

## Functions continued

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

In this example, we shortened

```go
x int, y int
```

to

```go
x, y int
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"
func add(x, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(4,9))
}
```
